# This script uses the c-lightning and bitcoin modules to interact with the Lightning Network and Bitcoin. 
# The script first sets the network to testnet (which is a test version of the Bitcoin network that uses fake bitcoins), 
# and then it creates a new Lightning client instance. The script then sets the parameters for 
# the loan application, such as the loan amount, term, and interest rate. It then generates a new Bitcoin address for receiving the loan, 
# and it sends the loan amount to that address. Once the payment is confirmed on the network, the script calculates the total amount to be repaid, 
# including interest, and it sets the repayment date for the loan. The script then creates a new invoice for the repayment of the loan, 
# and it prints the payment request for the invoice. This payment request can be shared with the borrower, who can use it to make the repayment 
# on the specified date.



# Import the necessary modules
import c-lightning
import bitcoin

# Set the network to testnet (you can also use mainnet if you have real Bitcoin)
bitcoin.SelectParams("testnet")

# Create a new Lightning client instance
lightning_client = c-lightning.Lightning()

# Connect to a local Lightning node
lightning_client.connect("localhost")

# Set the parameters for the loan application
loan_amount = 0.1  # The amount of the loan in Bitcoin
loan_term = 30  # The term of the loan in days
interest_rate = 0.01  # The interest rate for the loan

# Generate a new Bitcoin address for receiving the loan
loan_address = lightning_client.newaddr()

# Send the loan amount to the loan address
payment_hash = lightning_client.sendpay(loan_address, amount=loan_amount)

# Wait for the payment to be confirmed on the network
lightning_client.waitsendpay(payment_hash)

# Calculate the total amount to be repaid (including interest)
total_amount = loan_amount * (1 + interest_rate)

# Set the repayment date for the loan
repayment_date = loan_term * 24 * 60 * 60  # 30 days in seconds

# Create a new invoice for the repayment of the loan
invoice = lightning_client.invoice(total_amount, "Loan repayment", "Loan", repayment_date)

# Print the payment request for the invoice
print("To repay the loan, please send a payment to the following address:")
print(invoice["payreq"])

# Disconnect from the Lightning node
lightning_client.disconnect()
